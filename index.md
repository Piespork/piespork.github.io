# Starting The Project
The road of this project seemed like a long one, but through much work I was able to learn about how useful new technology can be, and also how frustrating things may seem at times. The project started simple enough: find something to 3D model. The main goal was to take something from the physical world and bring it into the digital. This task was not something I've ever done before, but thankfully it is something that can be done one step at a time.

As a class, we discovered that digital history is much more complicated than it seems, and also is fairly new. The idea of preserving some physical thing may sound simple but is actually quite different from what people expect. Digital and physical artifacts share many similar, complex qualities that can define the objects true nature. For example, if something is just a copy then how does its value compare to the original? What does something that is 'original' truly mean? Questions such as these were incredibly important as we started our project and decided what it is we'd be making.

My project evolved from a simple fish into something so much more. Through success and failure, my project began as a Cuban fish sculpture that somehow evolved into a mashed-together fish revolutionary: Fish Guevara. At the begining of the project I had no idea where my project would take me. Just based off of the brief description Prof. Graham had given us, we would be taking something from the physical world and 3D-scanning it into the digital. We would then be mashing-up the digital artifact to create something new. We would then take our digital artifacts and place them into an environment of our choosing (it could be a video game, a text based story, or even on a social platform like twitter). Finally we would be tasked with taking our digital artifacts and bringing them back into the physical world. Through this process we would need to understand not only how to manipulate our artifacts, but why we were manipulating them. What was the purpose of mashing things together? Of bringing things back to the physical world? This process allowed us to take a deeper look into the methods of documentation that need to apply to digital artifacts. Furthermore, how digital artifacts can be used to maintain objects, but also present objects in new ways that have never been experienced before. 


# Module 1
I personally found Module 1 to be the hardest part of this project. Not because I had trouble using the technology, but because I needed to find an object that would be appropriate to use as a model for the rest of the project. My inital idea was to scan a sword I own that I could then eventually put into a video game. This idea sounded great and had me generally excited. The sword itself had a history by coming from Thailand, and being fairly old. Sadly, I was unable to create a proper 3D-scan and went about another route. Several other objects were tested before I was able to settle on one. These included a centerpiece, a book, and a Dominican statue. However, the final object I had chosen was a Cuban fish scultpure.
