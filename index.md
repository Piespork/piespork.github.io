# Starting The Project
The road of this project seemed like a long one, but through much work I was able to learn about how useful new technology can be, and also how frustrating things may seem at times. The project started simple enough: find something to 3D model. The main goal was to take something from the physical world and bring it into the digital. This task was not something I've ever done before, but thankfully it is something that can be done one step at a time.

As a class, we discovered that digital history is much more complicated than it seems, and also is fairly new. The idea of preserving some physical thing may sound simple but is actually quite different from what people expect. Digital and physical artifacts share many similar, complex qualities that can define the objects true nature. For example, if something is just a copy then how does its value compare to the original? What does something that is 'original' truly mean? Questions such as these were incredibly important as we started our project and decided what it is we'd be making.

My project evolved from a simple fish into something so much more. Through success and failure, my project began as a Cuban fish sculpture that somehow evolved into a mashed-together fish revolutionary: Fish Guevara. At the begining of the project I had no idea where my project would take me. Just based off of the brief description Prof. Graham had given us, we would be taking something from the physical world and 3D-scanning it into the digital. We would then be mashing-up the digital artifact to create something new. We would then take our digital artifacts and place them into an environment of our choosing (it could be a video game, a text based story, or even on a social platform like twitter). Finally we would be tasked with taking our digital artifacts and bringing them back into the physical world. Through this process we would need to understand not only how to manipulate our artifacts, but why we were manipulating them. What was the purpose of mashing things together? Of bringing things back to the physical world? This process allowed us to take a deeper look into the methods of documentation that need to apply to digital artifacts. Furthermore, how digital artifacts can be used to maintain objects, but also present objects in new ways that have never been experienced before. 


# Module 1
I personally found Module 1 to be the hardest part of this project. Not because I had trouble using the technology, but because I needed to find an object that would be appropriate to use as a model for the rest of the project. My inital idea was to scan a sword I own that I could then eventually put into a video game. This idea sounded great and had me generally excited. The sword itself had a history by coming from Thailand, and being fairly old. Sadly, I was unable to create a proper 3D-scan and went about another route. Several other objects were tested before I was able to settle on one. These included a centerpiece, a book, and a Dominican statue. However, the final object I had chosen was a Cuban fish scultpure. 

The technology I used to take the 3D-scans was [Trinio](http://www.trnio.com/). Trinio allows users to take 3D-scans using a simple camera phone. In my case, I used an Iphone 6 to take my scans. The actual process of scanning is fairly simple, the app brings you through a tutorial in which you are then able to scan any object in the real world. However, some issues may occur when scanning. Lighting seemed to be the biggest concern for me, as I needed near perfect lighting to get proper scans. Some early models were decently done, but I felt I could do better: [The Book](https://sketchfab.com/models/d1f378747d704f85bf2dbd87edef3520), [The Dominican Statue](https://sketchfab.com/models/4cd812c487104407b07f6d7083889b5f), and [The Centerpiece](https://sketchfab.com/models/afb3508aa00d45c387f94e857d6fd173)

Once I had chosen my artifact to be modeled I was able to fully scan it. I found a kitchen table with an overhead light the best environment to perform my scan. The light was evenly distrubuted and was completly level. [I ended up with a scan I was happy with](https://sketchfab.com/models/90574af557eb40ae9cac54d49027d070), and was fairly happy with how easy Trinio made it to place the 3D-scan onto sketchfab. [Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/) was the easiest way for me to host all my 3D-models. After exporting my 3D-model I could then further trim any excess bits I didn't need, such as parts of the mat that the fish was on. To make the trimming I used [Meshlab](http://www.meshlab.net/), which made it fairly easy to remove any excess matierals of the model. The finished model that I used for the rest of the project: [Fish](https://sketchfab.com/models/15a1b981047649bbb55d11470419661d)

Something to keep in mind with the 3D-modeling of the fish sculpture is that it came from Cuba in a small market. Therefore, the original creator had no idea that one day his piece would make it into a university project about digital history. Sometimes its necessary to take a step back and understand how the physical aspect of digital history originated. Its important to understand that digital artifacts have a physical component, and that it is possible for the digital artifact to 'miss' something when digitized. The 'thing' that could be missing could be a sense (like the smell of an object), or perhaps some characteristic, like it being frail. 



# Module 2
Module 2 is where I ran into the most trouble with technology. The repeated phrase "its okay to fail!" kept coming back to me, which allowed to to make different choices. The main thing learned in this section was how to 'remix' or 'manipulate' something original (in this case our models), and turn it into something new. There were moral lessons about remixing, and especially about the importance of orginality. For our models we were given several choices on how to remix. For example, we could take the model's vertices and turn them into sound (via [Music Algorithms](http://www.musicalgorithms.org/3.2/)), we could mash two models together, or we could manipulate our models in some way. It wasn't simply about remixing, but instead about how remixing effects the model. Does turning it into sound produce any results that make sense? Does mashing models together produce any controversal outcomes? It is important not to only do the work, but understand the decisions being made along the way.

For my Module 2, I went through several choices before coming up with a final idea. My first idea was to combine my model fish with a model of Poseidon, Greek god of the sea. After looking through some models on Sketchfab, I came across an entirely different model: Che Guevara. Che Guevara is Cuba rebel fighter known for fighting with Fidel Castro to liberate Cuba. My fish model being from Cuba made things more interesting, and I began to think of an idea to on how to mash them together to create Fish Guevara. Prof. Graham had given us a few different technologies to use for mashing models together: [MeshLab](http://www.meshlab.net/), [MeshMixer](http://www.meshmixer.com/), and [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) were the most popular choices. I tried working with all three, but due to technical difficulties either my computer was crashing, the files wernt being saved, or something else came up that lead to disaster. Sadly, it seemed that Fish Guevara was not going to happen. 

I moved onto turning my fish model into sound, via the Music Algorithm website. Getting the vertices for the model was straight forward as I just took a look inside the .obj file in a text editor. Prof. Graham offered a [tutorial](https://programminghistorian.org/lessons/sonification) to teach how sonification can work. It was a great starting point and I was able to turn my model's vertices into sound. However, it didn't really sound like anything and this approach wasn't something I enjoyed. Therefore, I wanted to try something else with my model. Thankfully a classmate had directed me to another software for Windows 10: [3D-Builder](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/store/p/3d-builder/9wzdncrfj3t6). Its a lightweight, very simplistic, 3D-model builder. With the experience gained from working on Blender and Meshlab I was able to easily work with 3D-Builder. Thankfully I was able to make my dream come true: [Fish Guevara](https://sketchfab.com/models/349104360bfc4595b0a885a73e4cad1d).

Fish Guevara is a take on Cuban folk art (the fish) mixed with a Cuban rebel (Guevara). I feel that the mash-up is slightly controversial, but not for Canadians. It is hard to gain context about rebel fighters as a Canadian because Che Guevara is not apart of our culture; therefore, we'd have to put ourselves in the shoes of a Cuban to gain a better understanding of how using a rebel leader can either be insulting, or if it can be seen as a sense of pride.
